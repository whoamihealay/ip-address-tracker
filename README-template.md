## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Useful resources

- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The docs for React are solid,I mainly used them to look up the new hooks! Reading the framework/library docs is my go-to and has never failed me! Definite recommend!
- [React Context Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) - This was my first use of the Context library. I have used Redux so I wasn't completely lost and I'm very impressed at how easy it was to implement. (See was I call the Brad Taversy "System" for more info)
- [Axios Docs](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - Axios is amazing! It just works! The document is clear and concise! I use Axios for my HTTP request to the API and never had an issue with it.
- [React Route V6 Docs](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5) - I didn't even realize until a Switch didn't work that install version 6 of React-Router-dom. And instead of rolling back to version 5, I went with it. Thanks to their amazing Upgrade to V6 documentation, I was quickly back on track. I haven't fully used all the new possibilities (especially on Routes) but hope to do so in some refactoring.
- [Fireship.io](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship) - Awesome Youtube channel. Fireship.io has a "Concept/framework in 100sec" playlist to quickly learn the very basics of a Programming language, framework, or concept. There are also longer videos for more in-depth frontend mini-projects (CSS grid, flex...)
- [Brad Taversy](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia) - Awesome Youtube Channel and Udemy course on react and the Context library. I followed his React Crash Course and Udemy course on React. His implementation of Context is what I used and I feel very comfortable with it. It has a redux feel and I love it!
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - Discovered on FrontendMentor with the partnership on the Space challenge and where my CSS game step up to all new level (Have a look at my other challenges to see the differences)
- [Google](google.com) - Last but not least, the ultimate bug solver!
